ABSTRACT:

- ARM 
- cost-benefit analysis of sym. encryption algorithms combined with compression
- Assessment of 

INTRODUCTION:

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

- Disassembled applications (Todo List)
- Performance measured number of cycles 
- Assumptions:
  - One key is used for encryption
  - En-/Decryption routines are expected to be implemented most efficent i.e routines for differing encryption algorhitms are expected to be implemented on the same level of efficency.
  - En-/Decryption routines are expected to be reference implementation.
RESULTS:
